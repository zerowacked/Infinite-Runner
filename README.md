No Title Infinite Runner
===============

This project is designed to be a no-tutorial implementation of an infinite runner similar to Canabalt. 
It is designed to test my functional knowledge of Godot without assistance from YouTube tutorials (excluding QA/Forum/Discord inquiries).

It is a test bed for VCS functionality in Godot.

It is created on Godot 4.0.stable
